    <h4>Scheduler - Time based actions</h4>
    <p>You will get to know <i>Rules</i> in the next chapter, which are capable of executing
      actions when a given absolute point in time or a reoccuring schedule triggers.</p>

    <p>Time based actions can have a very simple purpose like a "Weekday wake-up timer".
      That's why we offer the <a href="schedules.html" class="demolink">Scheduler</a> page
      so that you can easily access time-based operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Item based time operations</h4>

    <p>There is one other use-case however. If you want to archive something along the line of
      "switch off a lamp, 5 minutes after it has been switched on".</p>

    <p>In this scenario, you go to the <a href="items.html" class="demolink">Items</a> page
      and for your target Item you head to the "Meta" tab. Edit the "expire" settings.</p>
