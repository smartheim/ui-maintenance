    <p>You will now learn all necessary basics to get you going with openHAB.<br>
      Right now you are using the <b>"Setup and Maintenance"</b> interface.</p>

    <details class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
      <summary>This tutorial and also this interface is strictly using new openHAB 2 technology.</summary>
      <p class="mt-2">Please be careful when reading user topics in our community, as those can reference
        older techniques. You want to avoid topics about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sitemaps</li>
        <li>DSL Rules (<i>.rules</i> files)</li>
        <li><i>.thing</i>, <i>.item</i> files</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <h4>What openHAB can do for you</h4>

    <img style="float:left;width: 160px;" src="img/openhab-logo-square.png">
    <p>openHAB is a mature home automation platform that is protocol agnostic,
      meaning it can connect to nearly any home automation hardware on the market today.</p>

    <p>You need to extend openHAB with additional software, called <i>Add-ons</i>, via this web interface.
      Add-ons add device &amp; services feature detection and moments later you can already control your external
      solution.
    </p>

    <p>Via scheduled tasks and rules you start automating your installation.
      For instance turning your lights on when your phone is in WiFi range, but only if it is already later than 6 pm.
      <b>Only your imagination is the limit.</b>
    </p>

    <p>openHAB also <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> and supports <abbr title="Do-it-yourself">DIY</abbr> and moddable
      hardware. We speak about this later on.</p>

    <h4>About this interface</h4>
    <p>Use this interface to setup new devices, configure existing ones, create automation rules and timers.</p>
    <p>Every section (except this tutorial) has a context help.
      Click on the question mark that appears next to the title.</p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info mb-4">
      You do not <b>control</b> your devices via this interface. Download the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid.beta">Android App</a>,
      iOS App, HaBot or use HabPanel instead. The last section of this tutorial deals with the different control
      interfaces.
